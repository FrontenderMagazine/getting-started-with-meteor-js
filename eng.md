Below is a guest post from [Ben Strahan][1], a meteor.js club member. He put
together a great post and I really wanted to share it with the whole Meteor.js 
Club!

## How do I become a web app developer - *Meteor style*  {#
howdoibecomeawebappdevelopermeteorstyle
}

What does an aspiring web developer need to know to develop a [Meteor][2] app?
Below is a list of languages, frameworks, libraries, packages & more;
) . 

The lists that follow are purposely ordered, unless noted. This article does
not explain why you need to learn each item (that is up to you to figure out). 
Instead this article's purpose is to provide a quick roadmap or "thousand mile" 
view of the technologies a Meteor Dev works with daily.

When you are in the weeds of learning new things it feels good knowing you have
a map to reference and measure your progress against.

## Languages, Libraries & Frameworks, oh my! {#languageslibrariesframeworksohmy
}

Ultimately you need to be able to understand [Meteor's API][4]. Getting a grasp
of the technologies listed below will give you what you need. There is no need 
to become an expert yet but you need to understand the structure and terminology
of each.

Don't know what an API is? [Check out this dude's video][5]

### Required {#required}

### Optional (learn when needed) {#optionallearnwhenneeded}

1.  [NodeJS][6] 
2.  [Cordova][7]
3.  [ElasticSearch][8]
4.  [Ionic][9] - Meteor Package [Meteoric][10] 

## MeteorJS {#meteorjs}

Now that you know the above you are deemed worthy to tap into the **power** and
awesomeness of Meteor!

Why did you need to learn ALL that stuff above before touching Meteor? Because
Meteor is considered a[Full-Stack][12] platform. Through Meteor you manage the
front-end, back-end and all the other ends.

...Okay no more question, lets learn MORE! 

Time to become a Meteor nerd, review the docs.

*   [Main API Documentation][4]
*   [Sub-Projects][13]

If the sub-projects look intimidating don't worry. At a minimum below are the
key packages in the sub-projects you need to know.

1.  [Blaze][14] 
2.  [Spacebars][15]
3.  [Tracker][16]
4.  [Utilities][17]

### Good Meteor Tutorials & Courses {#goodmeteortutorialscourses}

Ordered by difficulty & depth. These tutorials, courses, books & videos will
walk you through various Meteor projects. Everything you learned above will 
culminate.

## Meteor Packages (no order) {#meteorpackagesnoorder}

Yes there is even more to learn. Meteor has a package manager called 
[Atmosphere][18] which allows the community to build packages that deeply
integrate into the Meteor platform and expands the APIs available to you, the 
developer. Below is a list of the standard packages you will find in almost 
every serious Meteor app so you should get to know them.

## The rabbit hole goes deeper... {#therabbitholegoesdeeper}

Wow, you must really be committed if you got this far. Ok, so you want my super
secret lists?

### Service Providers {#serviceproviders}

When you go to deploy your app online there are a huge amount of service
providers available to a developer. Below are a few that specifically serve the 
Meteor community (and do a great job) so I decided to give them a shout.

*   [Kadira][19] - Performance Tracking
*   [Modulus][20] - Hosting (Use code 'Metpodcast' to get a $25 credit)
*   [Compose][21] - Mongo Database Hosting with Oplog

### Blogs, Vlogs, News & more (no order) {#blogsvlogsnewsmorenoorder}

Come drink the Meteor cool-aid with me... look we won't be alone.
